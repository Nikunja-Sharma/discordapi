# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Discord bot backend using Discord.js that can register slash commands and send messages to specific channels in Discord guilds/servers via POST requests. The system will provide a REST API interface for external applications to interact with Discord servers through the bot.

## Glossary

- **Discord_Bot**: The automated application that connects to Discord's API and responds to commands
- **Slash_Command**: Discord's native command system that appears when users type "/" in chat
- **Guild**: A Discord server containing channels and members
- **Channel**: A text or voice communication space within a Discord guild
- **REST_API**: The HTTP-based interface for external applications to interact with the bot
- **Bot_Token**: Authentication credential provided by Discord for bot access
- **Application_ID**: Unique identifier for the Discord application/bot

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a Discord bot backend, so that I can programmatically interact with Discord servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Discord_Bot SHALL authenticate with Discord using a valid Bot_Token
2. THE Discord_Bot SHALL maintain a persistent connection to Discord's gateway
3. WHEN the Discord_Bot starts, THE Discord_Bot SHALL log successful connection status
4. THE Discord_Bot SHALL handle connection errors and attempt reconnection
5. THE Discord_Bot SHALL store configuration in environment variables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register slash commands, so that users can interact with the bot through Discord's native command interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Discord_Bot SHALL register slash commands with Discord's API during startup
2. THE Discord_Bot SHALL support command registration for specific guilds
3. WHEN a slash command is invoked, THE Discord_Bot SHALL respond within 3 seconds
4. THE Discord_Bot SHALL handle command registration errors gracefully
5. THE Discord_Bot SHALL support command parameters and options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an external application, I want to send messages to Discord channels via POST requests, so that I can integrate Discord messaging into my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE REST_API SHALL accept POST requests with message content and target channel information
2. WHEN a valid POST request is received, THE Discord_Bot SHALL send the message to the specified channel
3. THE REST_API SHALL validate that the target channel exists and the bot has permissions
4. THE REST_API SHALL return success or error status codes for each request
5. THE REST_API SHALL require authentication for message sending endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bot to handle errors gracefully, so that the service remains stable and provides useful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid channel ID is provided, THE REST_API SHALL return a 404 error with descriptive message
2. WHEN the bot lacks permissions, THE REST_API SHALL return a 403 error with permission details
3. THE Discord_Bot SHALL log all errors with timestamps and context
4. WHEN Discord API rate limits are hit, THE Discord_Bot SHALL queue requests and retry appropriately
5. THE REST_API SHALL validate request payloads and return 400 errors for malformed data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the bot through environment variables, so that I can deploy it across different environments securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Discord_Bot SHALL read Bot_Token from environment variables
2. THE Discord_Bot SHALL read Application_ID from environment variables
3. THE REST_API SHALL read server port configuration from environment variables
4. WHERE authentication is enabled, THE REST_API SHALL read API keys from environment variables
5. THE Discord_Bot SHALL validate required environment variables on startup
